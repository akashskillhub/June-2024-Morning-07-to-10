            Question: Write a JavaScript code to determine if a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. 

            Explanation: print "Divisible by both" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, "Divisible by 3" if only divisible by 3, "Divisible by 5" if only divisible by 5, and "Not divisible by 3 or 5" otherwise.
        
            Case 1
            Input : const num= 15 
            Expected Output : Divisible by both 
        
            Case 2
            Input : const num= 10 
            Expected Output : Divisible by 5 
        
            Case 3
            Input : const num= 9 
            Expected Output : Divisible by 3 
        
            Case 4
            Input : const num= 7 
            Expected Output : Not divisible by 3 or 5 
    
     */
        const num = 9
        // write your code here
        if (num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("both")
        } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
            console.log("div. by 3")
        } else if (num % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("div. by 5")
        } else {
            console.log("Not divisible by 3 or 5 ")
        }
